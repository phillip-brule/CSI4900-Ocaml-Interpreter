        <h1>About Ocaml Interpreter</h1>
    </div>  
    <p>There is often some confusion between what an interpreter is and a compiler. 
    A compiler generally takes your code and then converts & optimizes this code into 
    lower-level machine code (nowadays often byte code) that your machine will then be 
    able to understand and run, usually in the form of an executable. An interpreter 
    on the other hand takes your code and executes it right away. An advantage of this, 
    is that as long as you have the interpreter the code can run on any system.
